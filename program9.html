&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer programming is defined as telling a computer what
to
do through a special set of instructions which are then
interpreted by the computer to perform some task(s). These
instructions can be specified in one or more programming
languages including (but not limited to) Java, PHP, C, and
C++. A computer goes through a series of steps whose purpose
is to achieve something a
series of steps that are
instructed to it in great detail by computer programs.
Essentialy, computer programming is the process by which these
programs are designed and implemented.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While computer programming can be a great tool used to
achieve
many things, there are a few misconceptions when it comes to
the subject, a few misconceptions that should be cleared up.
One misconception about computer programming is that you would
need to have some kind of special software to write programs this
is hardly the case.
